# Transaction costs

When I was a grad student working on how utilities operated in regulatory systems, I thought a lot about transaction costs. You can think of transaction costs as "the cost of doing business." They're the additional costs you take on when you operate in less than perfect free markets. They tend to be high when:

- You have to make decisions with incomplete or asymmetric information; you don't have all the info and you don't know what info others might have.

- You can't assume aligned incentives; you have to spend a lot of time figuring out what others want and negotiating with them.

- You can't assume people will stick to the plan: even when you agree to a deal, there are limited guarantees others will honor it.

# The classic choice: Free Markets or State Regulation

In the classic model, you have two options in a situation like this. You either solve everything by establishing clear and tradable property rights and perfect information (i.e., free markets), or you introduce some kind of third party to institute things like laws and regulations to make sure everyone behaves (i.e., state oversight).

Climate mitigation is a nice example. On the one hand, there are those who say, "just put a price on carbon and establish a market," and then there are others that say, "set binding targets and enforce via regulation."

# Elinor Ostrom and the governance approach

What was interesting at the time when I was studying was that a woman called Elinor Ostrom had just received the Nobel Prize for demonstrating that this isn't really how humans operate in practice. Through primary data gathered across cultures and geographies, she demonstrated humans are capable of collective action without the need for property rights or state intervention. Instead, through cultural norms, reciprocity, and negotiated rules and rights, people build trust and self-organize in a diverse set of ways that suit their local context and achieve socially optimal outcomes.

In Ostrom's models, trust is central. It is the outcome of careful negotiation and requires constant maintenance and reinforcement. In the absence of blind self-interest or fear of state penalties, it is trust, built on relationships, reciprocity, and a common understanding, that provides a basis for operating with lowered transaction costs.

# Transaction costs in startup teams

I've been thinking this model maps nicely onto the world of teams working in a startup context. All the ingredients are present for high transaction costs. We operate under high ambiguity (incomplete and asymmetric information), we often find ourselves having to quickly renegotiate our objectives and our terms of engagement (bargaining), and we are constantly faced with the uncertainty of whether or not other teams and individuals will follow through as expected (enforcement).

Similarly, we face three broad options from an organizational standpoint that feel analogous:

**Free market models:** When things move fast or scale quickly, most software engineers and managers want to talk about one thing: boundaries and ownership. If you are a software engineer who needs to develop a single service to a high standard, it really helps to be able to say, "I own this part, you own that part, and here are the contracts we use to trade commodities across these boundaries." This, to me, is just the software version of establishing property rights.

**Top-down regulation models:** Enter what is sometimes derisively referred to as "waterfall" planning, but honestly there are times when some top-down structure is extremely healthy. This often comes in the form of roadmaps, PRDs, technical design docs, review processes, stage gates, etc. These provide a lot of comfort to teams when they just want to know what "the plan" is and "who's doing what" in a formalized way that has some guarantee of being enforced.

**Governance-based models:** Then there is the world of teams self-organizing around a well-defined problem, negotiating their own terms of operation, and achieving collective action without any top-down authority. I have seen this referred to as "pods" or "agile teams," but they are all basically following Ostrom's pattern of a group of people who live and breathe the problem they are trying to solve, have a strong shared sense of culture and community, communicate freely and efficiently, and **trust each other**.

# Fostering trust as leadership

In practice, I don't think the models of collective action outlined above are in competition. I think they co-exist in all companies. Your challenge as a technical leader is figuring out which element to emphasize in which context. If a team or individual seems overstretched or dragged into too many projects, boundaries are great. If there is collective inertia, or perhaps people simply need a plan so they've got a straw man to critique, top-down models can help. But I think what everyone craves is to live in that third category: governance. I think that's where the magic of really effective software teams happens.

The trouble is, boundaries and top-down approaches are well defined, and the tools to get them in place are well known. Fostering good governance, on the other hand, setting up the conditions for a team to be able to self-organize, is extremely difficult.

Staying on the theme of trust and how to promote it in teams, I've begun to separate the concept into two sub-categories: trust given, and trust earned.

## Trust given

For me, trust given is about how you show up to your role. It is the foundational cultural norm that guides a team's view of themselves and each other. Regardless of capabilities, skills, or context, you must show up believing your teammates are honest people who want the company to be successful just as much as you do. Sometimes companies will express this as "assume good intent."

In sociology, there is another term for this called the [truth-default theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth-default_theory). In practical terms, the theory observes that humans have a huge bias towards assuming others are telling the truth. Not due to naivety, but because it would be so incredibly time-consuming and inefficient if we didn't (transaction costs pop up again...).

Ultimately, your role as a leader here is to walk the walk: make sure you assume that good intent and honesty in everyone you deal with and let others know you expect that from them.

## Trust earned

Trust earned is where things get harder. Trust earned is around those elements that can't be assumed but must be demonstrated. This can be around trust in your technical capabilities, your ability to follow through on an agreed plan, your ability to communicate in a timely and accurate manner. Trust earned is fragile; it often takes months to build and can be wiped out with a single misunderstanding or mistake.

Your role as a leader here is to create as many opportunities as possible for trust to be earned and reinforced within a team. Recognizing when a technical problem has clear scope and boundaries, knowing who the team is that lives in that technical space, recognizing interpersonal tensions, or reinforcing healthy shared cultures. It can be vague and frustrating, and carries a high risk of error, especially when working remotely as I do.

Above all, though, is to visibly hold yourself accountable to the same principles. While you should expect trust given that your intentions are good, you should also make it clear that you intend to earn the trust given. Upon reflection, I think some of the highest points of my career have been when I have felt that trust has been earned.
