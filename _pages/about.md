**Hi, I'm Gareth**

I'm a data scientist with a theoretical background in physics and political economy. Over the last 20 years or so I have worked in academia, government, consultancy, and tech. The problems I've been focused on solving have been mostly in sustainable natural resource management, utility operations and planning, and critical infrastructure monitoring and maintenance.

# My current work
## Power management in data centers

Currently serving as Principal ML Infrastructure Engineer at Utilidata, where I'm focused on minimizing time-to-value for deployed machine learning applications in edge computing environments within the data center space. This role combines my passion for ML infrastructure optimization with the unique challenges of deploying AI solutions at the edge.

## Agile leadership
Over the years I've learned where I thrive and what I love doing. It turns out I like to work and grow across three domains of agile leadership:

**Building Expertise**: I believe technical leadership starts with a low ego and solid awareness of the limits of your knowledge. ML and AI evolve rapidly, and there is simply no way to be the expert on everything. I am a fan of technical leaders who know when to say 'I got this' and when to say 'I don't know', 'let's find out', or 'teach me'. I try to model this whenever I can. I intentionally carve out time (on the job or my own time) to keep my own toolbox up to date (mostly analytics, model development, and MLOps) while also maintaining a healthy interest in the expertise of my teammates (e.g. DevOps, data engineering, embedded system architecture, site reliability engineering).

**Achieving Outcomes**: I like to lean into coordination and planning. I tend to gravitate to strategic roles where I'm driving outcome orientation in tricky interdependent contexts. I've been working remotely for the last 10 years, which makes this task especially challenging. There's a lot of emphasis on good remote practices like strong documentation and sources of truth (code documentation, wikis, Jira, Asana, etc.), refining rituals for efficiency, and clear and efficient synchronous and asynchronous communication.


**Catalyzing Growth**: There are times, especially in startups, when you don't know how the problem will get solved. All you can do is make fast efficient decisions and execute. I've found this is usually a time of rapid growth at an individual and collective level. It's when you learn the most, establish and reinforce team culture, and develop a shared understanding of your value proposition. My focus at these times is on trust. It takes a certain level of trust to be able to admit your own ignorance or to ask for help. It requires trust to step up and offer that help even if it might not be perfect. It requires trust to quickly make decisions, assign tasks, and execute, all while assuming your teammates have your back. Trust in turn is built on the back of making sure people feel valued, safe, and empowered. I do my best to understand the people I work with as complete individuals who are on their own growth journey, and treat them with dignity and respect.

# My past work
## Solar asset performance assurance
I worked as the head data scientist at Omnidian, a solar asset performance assurance startup. We leveraged ML pipelines to improve the efficiency and performance of our remote monitoring and operations platform. My work tended to span:

- **Team Leadership**: Managed and mentored data science teams, growing capabilities from inaugural ML services to comprehensive AI-driven solutions
- **Technical Vision**: Championed ML/AI adoption across organizations, presenting technical deep-dives to investors and stakeholders at Series A, B, and C funding rounds
- **Infrastructure Innovation**: Early adopter and implementer of modern ML infrastructure including DataBricks ecosystem, Spark, MLflow, and feature stores

## Utility policy, regulation, and finance

I worked as a senior consultant for a multinational design and engineering firm (WS Atkins). I worked in their Utility transaction advisory division. I contributed to technical and financial buyer and vendor due diligence reports. I also worked with national regulators, utilities, and policy makers in North Africa and Eastern Europe to deliver regulatory reform, infrastructure investment plans, and economic impact assessments.

## Academia and public policy

I hold a PhD in Geography and Environment from the University of Oxford with specialization in econometric and GIS applications, an MSc in Water Science Policy & Management, and a BSc in Physics with Philosophy of Science from King's College London. I spent a while in academia publishing papers on water policy, regulation, and planning. I also worked with the UK government on policy and planning focused on migration, conflict, and water scarcity.
